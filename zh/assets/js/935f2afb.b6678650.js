It will also cover how the keys are generated, stored, and used. These systems are designed to be flexible enough to support many different configurations and pooling setups and to be resilient to various attacks.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"keys/plot-ids":{"id":"keys/plot-ids","title":"Plot IDs","description":"A plot ID is a 32-byte value that is used as a deterministic seed to create an entire plot. In other words, two plots with the same plot ID will create byte-identical plot files. Plot IDs are public values that get put into Proof of Space objects.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"keys/plot-public-keys":{"id":"keys/plot-public-keys","title":"Plot Public Keys","description":"So, what is the plot public key shown in the previous section? The plot public key can technically be any BLS public key. As long as the correct signatures are included in the block, full nodes will allow it. However, BLS allows us to combine many public keys into one, which allows native N-of-N signatures without full nodes noticing that a multi-signature is used. In the current versions of chia-blockchain, we use this to our advantage to increase security. Please note that these schemes are not consensus critical, and therefore some farmers might use different strategies for generating their public keys.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plotting/k-sizes":{"id":"plotting/k-sizes","title":"K Sizes","description":"Temp storage requirements are for the chiapos plotter. Temp space differs for other plotting software, but final plot size will be the same.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plotting/moving-plots":{"id":"plotting/moving-plots","title":"Moving Plots","description":"Plots are just a static file. Plots can be moved from one folder/directory to another, and even to another machine (of a different operating system). It may also be mounted from an external USB drive or over the network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plotting/plotting-basics":{"id":"plotting/plotting-basics","title":"Plotting Basics","description":"Keep it simple. Focus on learning what Chia is and how to make one plot. Once you do that, move on to doing more.

It does not rely on any 3rd party, closed code, or trusted behavior.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/pool/pool-protocol-specification":{"id":"protocol/pool/pool-protocol-specification","title":"Pool Protocol 1.0 Specification","description":"This is the initial version of the Chia Pool Protocol. It is designed to be simple, and to be extended later. It relies on farmers having smart coins (referred to as plot NFTs in GUI + CLI) which allow them to switch between pools by making transactions on the blockchain. Furthermore, it decreases the reliance on pools for block production, since the protocol only handles distribution of rewards, and it protects against pools or farmers acting maliciously.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/protocol":{"id":"protocol/protocol","title":"Chia Protocol","description":"The Chia protocol is composed of a few different sub-protocols. All protocol messages are sent encoded in Streamable format, using the networking protocol defined in the Networking page.
