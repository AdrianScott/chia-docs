NFTs are non-fungible tokens that are minted on the Chia blockchain. The NFT puzzle ensures that there is only ever one copy of a given NFT, and it cannot be divided into multiple coins.

They can be used to prove digital ownership of files such as images or videos, as well as the metadata and license pertaining to the file.
