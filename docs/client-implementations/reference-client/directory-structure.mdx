`chia-blockchain` is the first and official implementation of the Chia protocol. It is written
in python, with a few dependencies written in C++ or rust in order to improve performance. It
is written from the ground up by the Chia team as well as open source contributors, and is not
a fork of any other blockchain system.

The codebase is split into several subfolders which categorize code on the different components
of the system. Inside the source root (chia folder).

- **cmds**: Contains the command line interface program, which is a python wrapper around the chia RPC api. When a command is run, a connection is established directly to the Chia services running locally.
- **consensus**: Consensus critical code that is high risk to change.
- **daemon**: Server that runs the daemon, launching and stopping the other services.
- **farmer**: Farmer server which handles signing blocks, coordinating the harvesters and communicating with a node.
- **full_node**: A large portion of the business logic of Chia is here, storing blocks and coins, full node protocol, etc.
- **harvester**: Code to handle harvester interaction with plot files and the filesystem
- **introducer**: Temporary introducer server which has been partially replaced with DNS introducers.
- **plotters**: Code for wrapping 3rd party plotters such as MadMax and Bladebit.
- **plotting**: Code for creating plots and handling plot creation parameters, as well as checking plot correctness.
- **pools**: Code for the handling of plot NFTs and pooling (on the wallet side).
- **protocols**: Protocol specification, also explained in section 10.
- **rpc**: RPC Server and RPC api specification for all services.
- **server**: Networking and Websocket server.
- **simulator**: A wrapper around the full node which allows creating and farming blocks, and running a local custom blockchain.
- **ssl**: Managing TLS connections and certificates.
- **timelord**: Code for running timelords, which uses the `chiavdf` dependency and connects to vdf clients.
- **types**: Blockchain format and python types used throughout the project.
- **util**: A collection of many utility files and functions used throughout the project.
- **wallet**: Subdirectory containing all code relating to wallets and chialisp. This contains a large amount of code.

# Chia Directory Structure Logs, Database, and More

ðŸ”§ Work in progress ðŸ”¨

For all operating systems (OS), the location for you Chia directories (folders) that contain the database, configuration, logs, etc. is in directories inside your home folder.

# Home Directory

Most if not all of the Chia software's folders and data will be in your home directory. While the concept is similar across operating systems, the details differ.:

| OS           | Home Directory                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Linux/Ubuntu | `~/` or `/home/yourusername`  |
| macOS        | `~/` or `/Users/yourusername` |
| Windows      | `C:\Users\yourusername`       |

## Home Directory General Structure

For Linux, Windows, and macOS, the configuration files are in a hidden `.chia` folder. The application file location varies depending on your operating system.

### Unix-based systems (Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)

```
/home/user
