  <summary>Note about Python <code>RuntimeError</code> on Windows</summary>

If you are running on Windows, you might occasionally see a Python Runtime Error. This is a [known issue in Python](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4324 "More info about this issue") and can be safely ignored. For example:

```powershell
chia stop -d all

Exception ignored in: <function _ProactorBasePipeTransport.__del__ at 0x000001A719716160 >

### Install Chia from source

This section will show you how to download and install Chia from the `latest` branch.

:::tip
Your firewall might give warnings when installing Chia. This is normal. Allow the installations to continue.
:::

Before doing anything else, you can begin to download a copy of the testnet10 blockchain database. [Click here to begin the download.](https://download.chia.net/testnet10/blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite.gz "Chia's testnet10 database download site") Save the file to your Downloads folder.

:::note
The file you will download is around 15 GB, compressed. Uncompressed, it will be around 30 GB. Make sure you have at least this much free space, and ideally 50 GB.
:::

You may continue with the next steps while the download is in progress.

#### Stop your current installation of Chia

:::info
If you are unsure of how to run the commands from this step, you can reboot your computer and proceed to the [Next step after stopping Chia](#next-step-after-stopping-chia).
:::

* If the wallet GUI is running, close it
* If you previously installed Chia using our packaged installer, then open a terminal (MacOS/Linux) or a Powershell window (Windows), and enter the following command:
  * Windows (be sure to replace `<username>` and `<version>` with the actual values): `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-<version>\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\chia.exe stop -d all`
  * MacOS: `/Applications/Chia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon/chia stop -d all`
  * Linux: [todo] 
* If you previously installed Chia from source, then activate a virtual environment and run `chia stop -d all`:

#### Next step after stopping Chia

```powershell
(venv) PS C:\> chia stop -d all
Daemon not started yet
Couldn't connect to chia daemon
```

Make sure to deactivate your virtual environment before continuing:
```powershell
(venv) PS C:\> deactivate
PS C:\>
```

#### Clone and install Chia

In this step you will use the git CLI tool to clone the `latest` branch of the `chia-blockchain` repository, as well as install Chia.

First, make and `cd` to a new directory where you'll run Chia. You can name this directory whatever you want. This tutorial will call it `prefarm_test`:

  ```powershell
  PS C:\Users\User> mkdir prefarm_test

    Directory: C:\Users\User

  Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
  ----                 -------------         ------ ----
  d----           5/23/2022  9:51 AM                prefarm_test

  PS C:\Users\User> cd prefarm_test
  PS C:\Users\User\prefarm_test>
  ```

Locally clone the branch you just created

:::info
If you don't already have the `git` CLI tool installed, [follow these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it
:::

Run `git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain.git -b latest --recurse-submodules`. 

This command should take less than 30 seconds to complete, depending on your internet connection.

```powershell
(venv) PS C:\Users\User\prefarm_test> git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain.git -b latest --recurse-submodules

Install Chia:
  ```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    defaultValue="windows"
    values={[
      {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
      {label: 'Linux/macOS', value: 'nix'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="windows">
  ```
  ```powershell
  cd chia-blockchain
  .\Install.ps1
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  chia init
  ```
  ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nix">
  ```
  ```bash
  cd chia-blockchain
  sh install.sh
  . ./activate
  chia init
  ```
  ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```

:::tip
If you receive the message `WARNING: UNPROTECTED SSL FILE!` then run:
```powershell
chia init --fix-ssl-permissions
```
:::

### Change your configuration to use the testnet

Run the following command to set up Chia to use the testnet:
```bash
chia configure --testnet true
```

### Add a new key pair

You should a public/private key pair specifically for testing the custody tool. Here's how to generate one:

```bash
chia keys generate
```

This will give an output such as the following:
```bash
Generating private key
Added private key with public key fingerprint 3049838316
(...)
```

Copy the fingerprint number (on paper or on your computer) for later reference.

  You are recommended to write down your seed phrase for later recovery. Run the following: 

  ```bash
  chia keys show --show-mnemonic-seed
  ```

  You'll be shown your public and private keys. The last line of the output will be a list of 24 secret words. This is your _seed phrase_. Copy the words on paper or on your computer for later recovery.
  ```text
  Showing all public and private keys

  Fingerprint: 3049838316
  (...)
	Mnemonic seed (24 secret words):
  // highlight-next-line
  youth stomach social aware clay pottery benefit asthma mail cry rubber panda wife around provide atom cute sand staff exotic pink east gloom minute
  ```

### Start and sync your wallet

First, start your wallet by running:

  ```bash
  chia start wallet
  ```

Next, wait for your wallet to sync. You can view the status of your wallet with the following command:

  ```bash
  chia wallet show
  ```

  Be sure to select the correct key/fingerprint, which you obtained from the `chia keys show` command:

  ```text
  Wallet keys:
  1)   285637561
  2) * 3049838316 (Not Synced)
  Choose a wallet key [1-2] ('q' to quit, or Enter to use 3049838316):
  Wallet height: 938814
  Sync status: Syncing...
  ```

  Syncing should only require a few minutes, unless your wallet has a large number of previous transactions. Eventually, the `chia wallet show` command will show that your wallet has been synced:

  ```text
  Wallet height: 938990
  Sync status: Synced
  Balances, fingerprint: 3049838316

  Chia Wallet:
     -Total Balance:         14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Pending Total Balance: 14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Spendable:             14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Type:                  STANDARD_WALLET
     -Wallet ID:             1
  ```

### Add some TXCH to your wallet

In order to run the custody tool, you'll need to have some TXCH in your wallet. If your total balance is 0, you can obtain 1 TXCH from our faucet. Copy the value of "First wallet address:" from the output of the `chia keys show` command. It will be a long string beginning with "txch". 

  Open our [testnet faucet page](https://testnet10-faucet.chia.net "Chia's testnet10 faucet link"). Paste your address and click "Submit".

  You'll receive this message: `Accepted. Your request is in the queue and will be processed in the order it was received.` At some point you'll receive 1 TXCH. Depending on how busy the faucet and the testnet are, this could take several minutes. However, you don't need to wait for your coins to arrive before continuing.

### Sync your node

1. Create the folder where your database will reside:

	```bash
	mkdir ~/.chia/mainnet/db
	```

2. You must wait for your database file to finish downloading before continuing. After the download has completed, use an archive manager such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zip's website") to extract the file. You should now have a file in your Downloads folder called `blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite`.

 Move the database to the folder you just created:
 ```bash
 mv ~/Downloads/blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite ~/.chia/mainnet/db
 ```

3. Start the full node, which will begin syncing to the database file:

  ```bash
  (venv) $ chia start node
  chia_full_node: started
  ```

4. Check the sync status:

  ```bash
  chia show -s
  ```

  Eventually, it will say `Full Node Synced`:
  ```text
  Network: testnet10    Port: 58444   RPC Port: 8555
  Node ID: 82a73b06b3a5f9493a3ac4e3d903026b39c85b748158ba41c623d531947f2a2a
  Genesis Challenge: ae83525ba8d1dd3f09b277de18ca3e43fc0af20d20c4b3e92ef2a48bd291ccb2
  // highlight-next-line
  Current Blockchain Status: Full Node Synced
  ```

You should now have a synced testnet10 full node and some TXCH.

If your requested TXCH has not yet arrived, post your address on the #dogfooding channel on Keybase. Someone might be able to send some to you.
