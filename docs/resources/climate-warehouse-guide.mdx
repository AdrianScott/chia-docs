## Installation and configuration

### Install and configure Chia and the DataLayer server

> Note: Your firewall might give warnings when installing both Chia and the Climate Warehouse. This is normal. Allow the installations to continue.

1. Download the latest [Chia installer](https://www.chia.net/download/)

2. Install Chia

:::info OS-Specific Instructions

</div>

Double click the .exe installer. The installation process will take less than 30 seconds on most computers.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

For Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions, run:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i chia-blockchain_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

For other distributions, see [the install Wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/INSTALL).

</div>

Double click the .dmg installer. After the installation completes, drag the Chia icon to the Applications folder.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

The Chia reference wallet GUI will start automatically after the installation completes.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
chia-blockchain &
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

Start Chia from your _Applications_ folder:

{' '}
<div style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/03_start_chia_mac.png" alt="Choose Farming Mode" />
</div>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

4. If this is your first time installing Chia on this machine, the `Select Your Client Mode` dialog will appear:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/data_layer/04_wallet_farming_mode.png"
    alt="Choose Farming Mode"
  />
</div>
<br />

- If you select `Farming Mode`, you will run a full node
  - Advantage: your wallet will respond faster than it would in `Wallet Mode`
  - Disadvantage: you need to sync the blockchain database, which can take several days if you are starting from the genesis block
- If you select `Wallet Mode`, you will only run a light wallet
  - Advantage: no need to sync a full node
  - Disadvantage: slower wallet performance
- Most Climate Warehouse users should select `Farming Mode`, in order to gain the long-term performance advantage of running a full node

5. If you don't already have a Chia private key (wallet), you will need to create one now. If you already have a private key, proceed to step 6.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/data_layer/05_create_private_key.png"
    alt="Create a private key"
  />
</div>
<br />

You will be shown a list of 24 words. Copy these words to a private location. Order is important.

:::warning important
Your seed phrase is all that is required to recover your wallet. If you lose your seed phrase, recovery will not be possible. If a bad actor gains access to your seed phrase, they'll be able to steal your Chia, including your Climate Warehouse funds. Do not take a picture of your seed phrase or store it on a computer.
:::

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/06_seed_phrase.png" alt="24-word seed phrase" />
  <figcaption>
    <em>
      Carefully copy your mnemonic seed phrase for future wallet recovery.
    </em>
  </figcaption>
</div>
<br />

6. The `Select Key` dialog will appear. If you see multiple keys, select one that has some XCH (if possible).

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/07_choose_key.png" alt="Select Key dialog" />
  <figcaption>
    <em>If the Select Key dialog appears, choose your primary key.</em>
  </figcaption>
</div>
<br />

7. Your wallet will begin syncing. "WALLET" will appear in the upper right corner. The orange dot indicates that the wallet is syncing. You may proceed to the next step while syncing is in progress.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/08_not_synced.png" alt="Not synced" />
  <figcaption>
    <em>The wallet is syncing.</em>
  </figcaption>
</div>
<br />

8. Open PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on Linux and MacOS.

We'll create an alias to run the `chia` command from any folder. We'll also fix any SSL permissions issues. Run the following command(s):

:::info Chia setup

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

(Be sure to update &lt;username&gt; and &lt;version&gt; to match the actual folder structure)

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name chia C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-<version>\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\chia.exe
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

Alias command is not needed, but you should still run the following:

```bash
chia init --fix-ssl-permissions
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

```bash
alias chia='/Applications/Chia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon/chia'
chia init --fix-ssl-permissions
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

9. Run `chia version`. You should be shown the correct version. For example:

```powershell
chia version
1.6.0
```

10. Run `chia configure --set-log-level INFO`. This will instruct your Chia installation to log more info than it would have with the default level of WARNING:

```bash
chia configure --set-log-level INFO
```

Bash:

```bash
Logging level updated. Check ~/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log
Restart any running chia services for changes to take effect
```

11. Acquire some XCH in order to use the Climate Warehouse. 0.01 XCH is a sufficient amount to get started. If you plan to use the Climate Warehouse long-term, you may need closer to 1 XCH.

:::tip
If you ever need to display your address, run `chia keys show`. This command will only output your public keys and address; your private keys and seed phrase will not be shown.
:::

12. Configure your router to forward ports 8575 (data propagation server) and 31310 (Climate Warehouse) to your local machine. To configure your router's settings, typically you will need enter `http://192.168.1.1` in a web browser, though this address varies for different routers. From your router's settings, locate the Port Forwarding section and add a rule to forward ports 8575 and 31310 to your local IP address.

13. You will also need to configure your computer's firewall to allow connections on ports 8575 and 31310. This process is different for each OS:

:::info Firewall setup

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    {label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

From a PowerShell prompt, run:

```powershell
start-Process powershell -Verb runAs
```

This will open a new PowerShell window as an Administrator. From this new window, you will need to run four commands, two for incoming connections and two for outgoing connections.

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allowDataServerIn" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8575
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allowDataServerOut" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8575
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allowClimateWarehouseIn" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=31310
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allowClimateWarehouseOut" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=31310
```

Each of these commands should give a response of `Ok.` Once you have successfully run the commands, exit the Administrator PowerShell window.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

Assuming you use iptables, which is installed on most distributions by default, run:

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8575 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8575 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 31310 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 31310 -j ACCEPT
```

Next, save the settings. For Ubuntu and Debian, run:

```bash
sudo /sbin/iptables-save
```

For CentOS, Red Hat, and Fedora, run:

```bash
/sbin/service iptables save
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

Open /etc/pf.conf in a text editor. You will need administrative privileges. For example:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/pf.conf
```

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```bash
# Open port 8575 for Chia Data Server
pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8575
# Open port 31310 for Climate Warehouse Server
pass in proto tcp from any to any port 31310
```

Save and close the file.

To load the changes, run:

```bash
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
```

To verify that the changes are active, run:

```bash
sudo pfctl -sr | grep 8575
sudo pfctl -sr | grep 31310
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

14. Start the DataLayer services:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/data_layer/09_start_data.png"
    alt="Start the DataLayer services"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <em>Enable DataLayer services.</em>
  </figcaption>
</div>
<br />

As shown in the above image:

- Click `Settings` on the lower left side of your wallet
- Click the `DATA LAYER` menu
- Click the slider to `Enable Data Layer`
- A slider titled `Enable File Propagation Server` will appear. Click this to enable it as well

Finally, you need to restart Chia. Close the GUI and run steps 3 and 6 above. When Chia starts, it will automatically enable both of the DataLayer services.

15. If the dot to the left of `WALLET` is green (indicating that your wallet is synced), then you may proceed. If it is still orange, then you need to wait for it turn green before continuing.

:::info
Regardless of the status of `FULL NODE`, you may safely proceed with this tutorial:

- Orange dot = full node is syncing
- Green dot = full node is synced
- `FULL NODE` is missing = you are running in `Wallet Mode`
  :::

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/10_synced.png" alt="Synced wallet" />
</div>
<br />

16. Chia uses the coin set (similar to UTXO) model of accounting. If you transferred XCH to this wallet in one transaction, then you have one coin, worth the total balance. However, several coins are needed in order to configure the Climate Warehouse. To fix this, send yourself some money, and include a small fee.

First, click the `RECEIVE` panel and click the clipboard to copy your address:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/11_copy_address.png" alt="Copy address" />
</div>
<br />

Next:

- Click the `SEND` panel and paste your address in the `Address/Puzzle hash` field
- In the `Amount` field, enter approximately 25% of your total XCH value
- In the `Fee` field, enter a small fee. For this example, we'll use 100,000 mojos
- Click `SEND`

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/12_send_money.png" alt="Send money" />
</div>
<br />

You will receive a dialog indicating that your transaction has been sent to the mempool. Click `OK`.

Next, click the `SUMMARY` panel. If you only had 1 coin, then your `Spendable Balance` will be `0`. The transaction will be `Pending` for a minute or so:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/13_send_pending.png" alt="Send pending" />
</div>
<br />

:::warning warning
If you attempt to send money while `Spendable Balance` is `0`, then you will receive an error dialog:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/data_layer/14_cant_send.png" alt="Cannot send" />
</div>
<br />
:::

After your transaction's status has changed from `Pending` to `Confirmed` and your `Spendable Balance` is greater than `0`, you will have two coins in your wallet. You should repeat the process to send yourself money two more times, increasing the amount a bit each time. For example, if you start with 1 XCH:

- First, send 0.25 XCH
- Next, send 0.26 XCH
- Finally, send 0.27 XCH

At this point you will have four coins in your wallet and you may proceed with the tutorial.

:::warning important
Be sure to vary the amount you send yourself, as shown above. If you continue to send yourself the same amount each time, then the coin matching the exact amount will be used. For example (**don't do this**):

- Start with one coin worth 1 XCH
- Send yourself 0.25 XCH
  - The 1-XCH coin is automatically selected
  - After the transaction has completed, you have two coins, worth 0.75 XCH and 0.25 XCH
- Send yourself 0.25 XCH (the same amount)
  - The 0.25-XCH coin is automatically selected
  - After the transaction has completed, you still have 2 coins, worth 0.75 XCH and 0.25 XCH
    :::

**Chia is now installed and configured properly. In the next sections, we'll install and configure the Climate Warehouse.**

3. To create your organization from the CLI (Can also be done later from the GUI):

   - Windows: Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/ 'Git for Windows website') (GitBash). Run the application, which looks similar to the Windows command prompt.
   - Linux and MacOS: Open a normal Terminal window.

4. Create your organization by running the following command (please be patient as it needs to update the blockchain):

```powershell
curl --location -g --request POST 'localhost:31310/v1/organizations/' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
  "name": "<Your Org Name>",
  "icon": "<Icon URL>"
}'
```

Be sure to replace `<Your Org Name>` and `<Icon URL>`. If you don't have an icon URL, you can use our default: `https://climate-warehouse.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/orgs/me.svg`

If the command succeeds, you will receive this message: `"New organization created successfully"`, along with an orgId. For example:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:31310/v1/organizations' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
  "name": "Test Org",
  "icon": "https://climate-warehouse.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/orgs/me.svg"
}'
```

Result:

```bash
{"message":"New organization created successfully.","orgId":"199c32268861147aac77644b03f823470fc69715cee55177fbf2df8a344762aa"}
```

5. Get your root hash

To verify your local organization, you can query its root hash by running `chia data get_root --id=<orgId>`, using the `orgId` from the previous command:

```bash
chia data get_root --id=199c32268861147aac77644b03f823470fc69715cee55177fbf2df8a344762aa
```

Result:

```bash
{'confirmed': True, 'hash': '0x0b6d6b7359278c48b8cd40ed20043618d58e2237b89905975c95b8b9ad4ab256', 'success': True, 'timestamp': 1662358829}
```

## Climate Warehouse tasks

### Create a new Organization

1. If you have not yet created your organization, you will need to do so now. Click `Create Organization`. If you already created your organization, proceed to the [next section](#create-a-new-project 'Create a project').

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/climate_warehouse/05_create_organization.png"
    alt="Create a new organization"
  />
</div>
<br />

2. Fill in your Organization Name, (optional) add an Organization Icon, and click `OK`:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/climate_warehouse/06_create_organization_fields.png"
    alt="Fill in fields to create a new organization"
  />
</div>
<br />

`Creating Organization` will be grayed out while the creation is in progress:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/climate_warehouse/07_org_creation_in_progress.png"
    alt="It takes a few minutes to create an organization"
  />
</div>
<br />

Several transactions need to be added to the blockchain, so it will take a few minutes to create your organization. You can see the transactions in progress by switching to your Chia wallet GUI:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/climate_warehouse/08_pending_chia_tx.png"
    alt="Chia needs to complete several transactions to create an organization"
  />
</div>
<br />

3. After your organization has been successfully added, you will be able to view its `Org UID`, `Public Address`, and other information:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/climate_warehouse/09_my_organization.png"
