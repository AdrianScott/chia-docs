Chia is a cryptocurrency and blockchain with smart transaction capabilities. Its [PoST consensus](/consensus-intro) is the first (and only) Nakamoto consensus since Proof of Work, and has a much [lower energy consumption](https://chiapower.org/).

Chia's mainnet was launched on March 19, 2021. Development of its ecosystem is ongoing, with primitives recently launched for [CATs](/cats), [Offers](/offers), [NFTs](/nfts) and [DIDs](/dids).

The Chia software is [easy to install](#install). You can start earning cryptocurrency rewards by storing plot files on your hard drive and leaving the machine running.

## Install Chia {#install}

The easiest way to install Chia is to use an installer. However, you can install from source if you want some extra control over the client.

For more detailed steps you can follow [these install instructions](/chia-installation-guide) according to your operating system. This software only supports 64 bit operating systems.

All configuration data is stored in a directory structure at the `$CHIA_ROOT` environment variable or at `~/.chia/mainnet/`. You can find databases, and logs there. Optionally, you can set `$CHIA_ROOT` to the `.chia` directory in your home directory with `export CHIA_ROOT=~/.chia` and if you add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` it will remain set across logouts and reboots. If you set `$CHIA_ROOT` you will have to migrate configuration items by hand or unset the variable for `chia init` to work with `unset CHIA_ROOT`.

If you are using the MacOS or Windows builds, your keys are created during the first run. We recommend writing down the mnemonic (24 ordered words).

## CLI Setup

Using the CLI with Chia gives you greater and more precise control. For a more details on the commands, read the [CLI Commands Reference](/cli).

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="MacOS / Linux" label="MacOS / Linux" default>

There are commands available in `/Applications/Chia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon`.

Try `./chia -h` or `./chia plots -h` for example. You can view your debug.log as it runs in from the terminal with `tail -f ~/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log`. Additionally, you can open the file with Console application.

A handy trick is to add that directory to your path - `export PATH=/Applications/Chia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon:$PATH`. To make it persistent add the same line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` inside of your user directory.

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

You can learn how to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the [Using the GUI page](/using-the-gui).

You can start with the Command Line Interface (CLI) by checking the commands available in `~\AppData\Local\Chia-Blockchain\app-1.1.5\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\`. Try `.\chia -h` or `.\chia plots -h` for example:

1. Open _PowerShell_

   On start menu type "powershell" and press the enter key.

2. Change Directory with `cd`

   On _PowerShell_ type `cd $env:localAPPDATA\Chia-Blockchain\app-1.1.5\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\` and press the enter key.

3. Read Chia help

   On _PowerShell_ type `.\chia -h` and press the enter key.

For more information you can read the [CLI Commands Reference page](/cli).

You can view your logs by opening `\.chia\mainnet\log\debug.log` with a text editor like _Visual Studio Code_ or see it as it runs in _PowerShell_ by using Get-Content, `Get-Content ~\.chia\mainnet\log\debug.log -wait`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

If you installed Chia with the Linux installer files, your Chia executable should be in one of the following locations:

`/usr/lib/chia-blockchain/resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon/chia`

`/lib/chia-blockchain/resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon/chia`

If you installed from source (using git), just activate and run `chia` directly.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Migrate or set up configuration files

```bash
chia init
```

### Generate keys

Create some keys by running the following script if you don't already have keys:

```bash
chia keys generate
```

### Run a full node + farmer + harvester + wallet

To run a full node on port 8444, and connect to the mainnet, run the following command. Logs are usually at `~/.chia/mainnet/logs/debug.log` or `~\.chia\mainnet\logs\debug.log` on Windows

Headless:

```bash
chia start farmer
```

GUI:

```bash
sh install-gui.sh
cd chia-blockchain-gui
npm run electron &
```

Farmers are entities in the network who use their drive space to try to create
blocks (like Bitcoin's miners), and earn block rewards.

## Plotting

Plotting is the process of creating plots to be farmed. Once a plot is created, it can be farmed indefinately. In other words, you do not have to plot forever, just plot until you are out of storage.

Reference our [plotting guide](/plotting-basics) for more details.

You can use the command line tools and change the working directories and output directory for plotting, with the `-t` (temp), `-2` (second temp), and `-d` (destination) arguments to the `chia plots create` command. `-n 2` will create two plots of type k=32.

```bash
chia plots create -k 32 -n 2
chia plots check -n 30
```

## Tips

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer, Amazon Linux 2, and CentOS 7.7 or newer are the
easiest linux install environments.

UPnP is enabled by default to open port 8444 for incoming connections.
If this causes issues, you can disable it in `config.yaml`. Or you can run this command: `chia configure -upnp false`
Some routers may require port forwarding, or enabling UPnP
in the router's configuration.

## RPC Interface

The Node has an [RPC interface](/full-node-rpc). This RPC will allow you to interact with the Chia node through code.
