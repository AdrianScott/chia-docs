The mempool is not dictated by the consensus rules; a farmer can change how their mempool functions and customize the rules without permission from other full nodes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"07networking/networking":{"id":"07networking/networking","title":"7.1 Networking","description":"The Chia protocol is asynchronous and peer-to-peer. It runs on top of WebSockets on port 8444 (or other ports for farmers and timelords).

These systems are designed to be flexible enough to support many different configurations and pooling setups and to be resilient to various attacks.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"09keys/plot_ids":{"id":"09keys/plot_ids","title":"9.2 Plot IDs","description":"A plot ID is a 32-byte value that is used as a deterministic seed to create an entire plot. In other words, two plots with the same plot ID will create byte-identical plot files. Plot IDs are public values that get put into Proof of Space objects.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"09keys/plot_public_keys":{"id":"09keys/plot_public_keys","title":"9.3 Plot Public Keys","description":"So, what is the plot public key shown in the previous section? The plot public key can technically be any BLS public key. As long as the correct signatures are included in the block, full nodes will allow it. However, BLS allows us to combine many public keys into one, which allows native N-of-N signatures without full nodes noticing that a multi-signature is used. In the current versions of chia-blockchain, we use this to our advantage to increase security. Please note that these schemes are not consensus critical, and therefore some farmers might use different strategies for generating their public keys.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"10protocol/full_node_protocol":{"id":"10protocol/full_node_protocol","title":"10.3 Full Node Protocol","description":"This protocol is a bidirectional protocol for communication between full nodes in the Chia system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"10protocol/harvester_protocol":{"id":"10protocol/harvester_protocol","title":"10.2 Harvester Protocol","description":"The harvester protocol defines the messages sent between a farmer service and a harvester service.

It does not rely on any 3rd party, closed code, or trusted behavior.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"11pooling/specification":{"id":"11pooling/specification","title":"11.2 Chia Pool Protocol 1.0 Specification","description":"This is the initial version of the Chia Pool Protocol. It is designed to be simple, and to be extended later. It relies on farmers having smart coins (referred to as plot NFTs in GUI + CLI) which allow them to switch between pools by making transactions on the blockchain. Furthermore, it decreases the reliance on pools for block production, since the protocol only handles distribution of rewards, and it protects against pools or farmers acting maliciously.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"12rpcs/datalayer_rpcs":{"id":"12rpcs/datalayer_rpcs","title":"DataLayer RPCs","description":"Note about Windows command escaping","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"12rpcs/did_rpcs":{"id":"12rpcs/did_rpcs","title":"DID RPCs","description":"Note about Windows command escaping","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"12rpcs/full_node_api":{"id":"12rpcs/full_node_api","title":"Full Node RPCs","description":"The full node RPC API is exposed by the full node, by default on port 8555.
